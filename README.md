# Crazy Crazy Robots (2D game)
This is a hobby project.

## Learning Journey
<b> Goal: </b> <br>
> Learn the basics of game development.

<b> Aims: </b> <br>
> Game is polished and ready-to-play. <br>
> Audio and visual feedback is satisfying.

<b> Objectives: </b> <br>
> Clean code and component structure. <br>
> Focus on script reusability and adaptability. <br>
> > Few dependencies, loosely coupled as much as possible.

## Preview

## Changelog (v1 to v2)
<li>Interaction and movement system converted from translation to physics. Objects now use rigidbody.</li>
<li>Layering of sprites on maps no longer accomplished using sorting layer. Unity's default transparency sorting is used instead.</li>
<li>Object pooling system revamped to accomodate multiple objects (and efficient adding of new objects)</li>
<li>Enemy artificial intelligence improved (raycast!)</li>
<li>Some prop scripts now use inheritence instead of duplicated code.</li>

## Future Implementations
<li>Technical - Switching to NavMesh pathing because I just learned about it :-)</li>
<li>Game mechanics - Countdown timer, score counter, leaderboard</li>
<li>UI - HUD, Menu, pause menu</li>
<li>Polishing - More sounds and animations, better feedback</li>
<li>To learn - Loot table, scriptable objects</li>
<li>Possibly a storyline</li>

## Notes
This is a non-commercial project.
